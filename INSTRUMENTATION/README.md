# INSTRUMENTATION

For long term experiments in the laboratory, communication with instruments are essential. Using Pyvisa library, data logging and controlling power sources can be made. This processes are called instrumentation.
These are the examples of the communication with laboratory instruments with using different communication protocols(GPIB-ETHERNET-USB) via Python.
There is a small list of the controlled instruments:
Keithley2000(DMM), Yokogawa GS200(Highly precise Current or Voltage Source), Rohde and Schwarz - HMP4040(Power Supply), AIM TTI TG5012A(Pulse Generator), NI-9215 with NI-USB-9162.
Please have a look example before use classes. Please have a look usage_of_classes.py file for more information.
At PDF file, Prologix configurations has been shown for communication.
