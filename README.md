# CERN-CALIBATION-OF-LHC-BCTDC

The project was the calibration of the LHC beam current transformers, Fast and DC. This project was performed in strong relation with the LHC physics experiments, which use the values provided by the BCTs for absolute luminosity measurement. The beam intensity characterization tests have been performed on the BCT electronic acquisition chain. A procedure was developed for validation and updating the calibration factors of the BCT. This procedure covered the development of sanity checks and cross-calibration routines using Python. With long term data acquisition, stability and linearity of DCCT(Direct Current Current Transformer) verified. Uncertainty of the 24-bit ADC is defined at the end of the project.
